# Feature Specification: Slack MCP Server (Read-Only)

**Feature Branch**: `001-slack-mcp-read-only`
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build Slack MCP server with only retrieving information features"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Workspace Channels (Priority: P1)

An AI assistant needs to help a user find and explore channels in their Slack workspace. The user asks the assistant to list available channels so they can understand the workspace structure and identify relevant discussions.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability. Without knowing what channels exist, users cannot navigate to retrieve any other information. This enables workspace discovery and orientation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting a channel list from a connected Slack workspace and verifying the response includes channel names, IDs, and basic metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a connected Slack workspace, **When** the AI requests the list of channels, **Then** it receives a list of public channels the token has access to with their names and IDs.
2. **Given** a workspace with many channels, **When** the AI requests channels with pagination, **Then** it receives channels in batches with cursor-based navigation.
3. **Given** valid credentials, **When** the AI requests a specific channel's details, **Then** it receives the channel's topic, purpose, and member count.

### User Story 2 - Read Message History (Priority: P1)

An AI assistant helps a user catch up on conversations in a specific Slack channel. The user wants to understand recent discussions, find specific information shared, or get context on a topic.

**Why this priority**: Reading messages is the core value proposition of a Slack integration. Users primarily want to retrieve and understand conversation content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting message history from a known channel and verifying messages include text, timestamps, and author information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid channel ID, **When** the AI requests message history, **Then** it receives recent messages with content, timestamps, and sender information.
2. **Given** a message thread, **When** the AI requests thread replies, **Then** it receives all replies in chronological order.
3. **Given** a large channel, **When** the AI requests history with a limit, **Then** it receives only the specified number of messages with pagination support.

### User Story 3 - Look Up User Information (Priority: P2)

An AI assistant needs to identify who sent a message or find information about a team member. The user asks about a colleague's role, contact information, or which user authored a specific message.

**Why this priority**: User information enriches message context and enables identification. Messages reference user IDs which need resolution to names and profiles for meaningful responses.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting user profile information and verifying it returns display name, real name, and other profile fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a connected workspace, **When** the AI requests the user list, **Then** it receives workspace members with their IDs and basic info.
2. **Given** a valid user ID, **When** the AI requests their profile, **Then** it receives their full profile including display name, title, and status.

---

### User Story 4 - Search Conversations (Priority: P3)

An AI assistant helps a user find specific information across channels. The user asks to find messages containing certain keywords, from specific people, or within a time range.

**Why this priority**: Search enables targeted information retrieval across the workspace. While valuable, users can often achieve similar results by reading specific channel history.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for a known keyword and verifying matching messages are returned with context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a search query, **When** the AI searches messages, **Then** it receives matching messages with surrounding context and source channel.
2. **Given** search results, **When** there are many matches, **Then** results are paginated and can be navigated.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the token lacks permission for a channel? System returns a clear authorization error without exposing private channel names.
- What happens when a channel or user ID is invalid? System returns a specific "not found" error with the invalid identifier.
- How does the system handle rate limiting from Slack? System surfaces rate limit information and suggests retry timing.
- What happens when the workspace has no accessible channels? System returns an empty list with a clear message rather than an error.
- How are deleted messages or archived channels handled? System indicates archived status; deleted messages are simply not returned.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST expose MCP tools for retrieving Slack workspace information.
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate with Slack using a Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-).
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a tool to list public channels accessible to the bot.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a tool to retrieve message history from a specified channel.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a tool to retrieve replies within a message thread.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a tool to list workspace users.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a tool to retrieve detailed user profile information.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a tool to search messages across accessible channels.
- **FR-009**: System MUST support pagination for all list operations using cursor-based navigation.
- **FR-010**: System MUST NOT include any tools that modify Slack data (no posting, reacting, or editing).
- **FR-011**: System MUST return structured responses conforming to MCP tool result specifications.
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle Slack API errors gracefully and surface meaningful error messages.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support configurable result limits for all retrieval operations.

### Key Entities

- **Channel**: A Slack channel (public) with ID, name, topic, purpose, and member count. Represents a conversation space users can retrieve messages from.
- **Message**: A single message in a channel with timestamp (ts), text content, user ID, and optional thread parent. Forms the core content users retrieve.
- **User**: A workspace member with ID, display name, real name, profile image, title, and status. Provides context for message authors.
- **Thread**: A message with replies, identified by channel ID and parent message timestamp. Represents a focused sub-conversation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can retrieve channel lists within 2 seconds for workspaces with up to 500 channels.
- **SC-002**: Users can retrieve message history (50 messages) within 2 seconds.
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully resolve user IDs to profile information for any message author.
- **SC-004**: System correctly handles 100% of Slack API rate limits without crashing or returning unclear errors.
- **SC-005**: All six core retrieval tools (list channels, get history, get thread, list users, get profile, search) are available and functional.
- **SC-006**: 95% of tool invocations return successfully when provided valid parameters and credentials.

## Assumptions

- The Slack workspace administrator has created a Slack App and installed it to the workspace.
- The Bot User OAuth Token has been granted appropriate read-only scopes (channels:read, channels:history, users:read, users.profile:read, search:read).
- The MCP client (AI assistant) is configured to connect to this server.
- Private channels are out of scope for the initial implementation (groups:read, groups:history not required).
- Direct messages are out of scope for the initial implementation (im:read, im:history not required).
